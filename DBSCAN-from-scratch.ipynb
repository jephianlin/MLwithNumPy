    "**Input:**  \n",
    "- `X` (whose `N` rows are samples and `d` columns are features)\n",
    "- `eps`: the $\\epsilon$ used for finding neighborhood\n",
    "- `min_samples`: a sample is considered as a core sample if its $\\epsilon$-ball contains at least `min_sample` samples (including itself)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output:**  \n",
    "- `y_new`: an array of shape `(N,)` that records the labels in of each sample, where `-1` stands for a noise \n",
    "- `core_indices`: an array of shape `(n_core_samples,)` that stores the indices of the core samples\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps:**\n",
    "1. Build a tuple `nbrhoods` that stores `i: array of indices of its neighbors` .  \n",
    "Here two points are neighbors if the distance between them is less than or equal to `eps` .  \n",
    "A point is considered as its neighbor.\n",
    "2. If sample `i` has at least `min_samples` neighbors, then it is called a core sample.  \n",
    "Store the indices of core samples in the array `core_indices` .\n",
    "3. Set `label_num = 0`.  Label every sample as with `-1`.  For each sample `i`, do the following [DFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search):\n",
    "    1. if sample `i` is a core labeled by `-1`, label it with `label_num`; otherwise, skip the following steps and move on the the next sample.\n",
    "    2. let `stack = neighbors of sample i`\n",
    "    3. take (and remove) the first element `j` in `stack`\n",
    "    4. if `j` is labeled by `-1`, label it with `label_num`  \n",
    "    5. if `j` is a core, insert the neighbors of `j` at the beginning of `stack`  \n",
    "    6. repeat Steps C, D, E until `stack` is empty\n",
    "    7. `label_num += 1`\n",
    "4. Return the labels as `y_new` .\n"
